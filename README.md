This project, inspired by the AI assistant JARVIS from the Iron Man movies, uses speech recognition, natural language processing, and text-to-speech technologies to create a conversational AI. Users can interact with the AI by speaking to it, and it can respond with generated text from the GPT-3 language model. The project also includes a customizable wake word and the ability to add more functionality and features. This project aims to showcase the capabilities of AI and provide a fun and interactive experience for users.
